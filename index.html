            <h2>How to play?</h2>
            <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to get
                three of your symbols in a row.</p>
            <h3>1. Set Up the Board</h3>
            <p>
                Draw a grid with two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, creating <strong>nine squares.</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Player 1</strong> is usually X</li>
                <li><strong>Player 2</strong> is usually O</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>2. Take Turns</h3>
            <p>Decide who goes first. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Once a mark is placed, it cannot be changed or moved!</p>
            <h3>3. The Objective</h3>
            <p>The goal is to align <strong>three</strong> of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Winner:</strong> The first person to get three in a row wins the game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Draw (Tie):</strong> If all nine squares are filled and no one has three in a row, the
                        game is a "Draw" (often called a "Cat’s Game").</li>
